+ **Project summary**: 
Whether you are moving to New York with your family and would like to find a school for your children, or your children has reached school age and you have no idea which school they should attend, you probably have many questions. What is the quality of each school? What are the housing options around the school? What's the best option for your children and your family? No worries, our app can help you figure out these questions.

    Our shiny app provides you information about school and housing in New York city, which benefits both parents and student.  For parents, our app provides detailed school information including teaching quality score, family-community ties score, etc, that helps parents select which school they want their children to attend. When combine school and housing information, parents can choose the best school option within the family housing budget. Furthermore, by looking at the median housing price of the area, they can also get a sense of the level of development and safety of 
the area, as well as the socioeconomic status of the people living 
in that neighborhood. For students, they can have a better understanding of the school they are attending with the school demographic information and learning environment score our app provided.
